                    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
                        From a very early age I knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up: a computer programmer. What took me a while to realize, however, was that I had many more passions beyond that.<br><br>
                        High school showed me my love for music. Everything from creating, dancing to, playing, or singing music, to simply just listening to it helped me develop a sense of community and started my journey on improving my social skills.<br><br>
                        After moving to the Bay Area from my tiny town of St. Paul, Oregon, which had a population of about 300 people, I further developed my social skills. This was especially evident after being hired at Teavana, as I got to work with a variety of people from all walks of life. My time at Teavana and eventually Hollister gave me the leadership and management experience I would need in order to lead a project of my own some day.<br><br>
                        Being in the Bay Area also showed me my passion for people, specifically from a human rights standpoint. Growing up gay and liberal in a very conservative town and household led me to become very passionate about people's rights as human beings, and the need to advocate for change in order to make the world a better place.<br><br>
                        While obtaining my B.S. in Computer Science from San Jose State University, I led and worked on projects ranging from simple whiteboard applications, to programs that could read a hand-written math equation using neural networks. This, along with my troubleshooting and QA testing for Cruise's autonomous vehicles have helped put me on the career path that I want to continue to pursue.<br><br>
                        I hope to use my knowledge and drive in the computer programming industry to further my passions for myself and for others.

            <p>
                Instead of focusing on content creation and hard work, we have
                learned how to master the art of doing nothing by providing massive
                amounts of whitespace and generic content that can seem massive,
                monolithic and worth your attention.

            <p>
                Yes I know you probably disregarded the earlier boasts as
                non-sequitur filler content, but its really true. It took years of
                gene splicing and combinatory DNA research, but our bananas can
                really dance.
