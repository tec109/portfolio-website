                    <p style="color: darkslategray;">
                        From a very early age I knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up: a computer programmer. What took me a while to realize, however, was that I had many more passions beyond that.<br><br>
                        High school showed me my love for music. Everything from creating, dancing to, playing, or singing music, to simply just listening to it helped me develop a sense of community and started my journey on improving my social skills.<br><br>
                        After moving to the Bay Area from my tiny town of St. Paul, Oregon, which had a population of about 300 people, I further developed my social skills. This was especially evident after being hired at Teavana, as I got to work with a variety of people from all walks of life. My time at Teavana and eventually Hollister gave me the leadership and management experience I will need in order to lead a project of my own some day.<br><br>
                        Being in the Bay Area also showed me my passion for people, specifically from a human rights standpoint. Growing up gay and liberal in a very conservative town and household led me to become very passionate about people's rights as human beings, and the need to advocate for change in order to make the world a better place.<br><br>
                        While obtaining my B.S. in Computer Science from San Jose State University, I led and worked on projects ranging from simple whiteboard applications, to programs that could read a hand-written math equation using neural networks. This, along with my troubleshooting and QA testing for Cruise's autonomous vehicles have helped put me on the career path that I want to continue to pursue.<br><br>
                        I hope to use my knowledge and drive in the computer programming industry to further my passions for myself and for others.
